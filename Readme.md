# 📈 Stock Price Prediction App

This is a **Stock Price Prediction App** built with **Streamlit** that predicts future stock prices using a trained LSTM model. The app provides both short-term and long-term predictions based on historical stock price data fetched using `yfinance`.

---

## 🚀 **Overview**

This project allows users to:  
✅ Predict stock prices for the next **5–6 months** (displayed in a table).  
✅ Forecast long-term stock trends for the next **5–6 years** (shown in a graph).  
✅ Show realistic market-like fluctuations (including falls).  
✅ Display Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) to visualize short-term trends.

## 📚 **Dependencies**

Create a `requirements.txt` file and add the following dependencies:

```txt
numpy==1.26.4
pandas==2.2.1
streamlit==1.31.0
tensorflow==2.16.1

## ▶️ **How to Run the App**

### **1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction-app.git
```

### **2. Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd stock-prediction-app
```

### **3. Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Run the Streamlit app:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### **5. Open the browser and visit:**

```bash
http://localhost:8501
```

## 📊 **How It Works**

1. **Enter a stock symbol** (e.g., `AAPL`, `TSLA`, `POWERGRID.NS`) in the input box.
2. The app fetches historical data using `yfinance`.
3. The data is processed and passed into a pre-trained LSTM model.
4. The app predicts future prices and displays:
   - **Actual vs Predicted Prices**
   - **Short-Term Target Prices** (for next 5–6 months)
   - **Long-Term Trends** (for next 5–6 years)
5. Download the dataset directly from the app.

---

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

- If the app doesn’t start, make sure all dependencies are installed.
- If you receive `No data found for symbol`, double-check the stock symbol.
- If TensorFlow model issues occur, reinstall TensorFlow:

```bash
pip uninstall tensorflow
pip install tensorflow
```

---

## 🧠 **How Predictions Are Made**

- The app uses a pre-trained **LSTM model** to predict future stock prices.
- Predictions include realistic market fluctuations using random noise for authenticity.
- The difference between consecutive target prices is limited to **±20** to simulate real-world trends.

## 📌 **Example Stock Symbols**

| Stock Symbol | Company Name          |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| AAPL         | Apple Inc.            |
| TSLA         | Tesla Inc.            |
| MSFT         | Microsoft Corporation |
| INFY         | Infosys Ltd.          |
| RELIANCE.NS  | Reliance Industries   |

## 🌟 **Future Enhancements**

- Add more technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).
- Improve fluctuation modeling with advanced noise functions.
- Implement multi-stock analysis.
